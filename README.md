🌟 Dataverse Event 2025 – Tic-Tac-Toe AI Workshop 🌟

Dataverse Event 2025! This event is organized to teach beginners and enthusiasts about AI, Machine Learning, and Python programming in a hands-on way through a fun project: a Tic-Tac-Toe bot using Decision Trees and Random Forests.

🧑‍🏫 Event Objective
The goal of this session is to provide participants with:
Introduction to Machine Learning models – Decision Tree and Random Forest.
Hands-on coding experience – Implementing a Tic-Tac-Toe bot.
Understanding GUI creation in Python using ipywidgets.
Analyzing model performance using accuracy metrics.

💻 Project Overview – Tic-Tac-Toe AI Bot
Participants will learn to:
Build a Decision Tree and Random Forest model to predict moves in Tic-Tac-Toe.
Create interactive GUIs for both AI bots, allowing users to play against them.
Visualize and compare model performance side-by-side.
Understand basic AI decision-making logic in games.

Features of the Project
Two AI Bots: Decision Tree Bot & Random Forest Bot.
Interactive GUI with Neon Pop colors: Blue for Player, Red for Bot.
Accuracy display for both models on test data.
Side-by-side interface to compare AI behavior in real-time.

🛠 Technologies & Tools Used
Python 3.x
pandas – Data handling
scikit-learn – Decision Tree & Random Forest models
ipywidgets – Interactive GUI creation
Jupyter Notebook / Colab – Hands-on coding enviro
